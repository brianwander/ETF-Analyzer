# ETF-Analyzer
This notebook reads data from locally stored .db files using SQL queries to analyze the returns of various assets in an ETF. Daily and overall returns are plotted with interactive line graphs.



## Technologies
This notebook runs on jupyter labs using python 3.7.15
The program uses the numpy, pandas, hvplot and sqlalchemy libraries.

## Installation Guide
Install python 3.7.15 and open etf_analyzer.ipynb using jupyter lab, ensuring that the etf.db file containing the data is in the same directory.

To view the web application displayed in the video, voila must be installed and run in the terminal using pip install voila.
After navigating to the directory containing the file, run the command: voila etf_analyzer.ipynb

## Usage
